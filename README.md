# PDB Molecule Library

This repository contains **PDB files for molecules that do not have readily available structures in public databases** (such as the RCSB PDB).  
When a moleculeâ€™s PDB file cannot be found, I create the structure myself using publicly available chemical data (e.g., PubChem, literature references) and make it available here.

## Purpose
- Provide PDB structures for small molecules, ligands, and other compounds that are missing from common molecular databases.
- Maintain a clear, organized collection that can be used for computational chemistry, molecular modeling, and related work.
- Share these files so others (and myself) can save time searching or recreating the same molecules.

---

Each molecule folder contains:
- **PDB file(s)** of the molecule or related structures.
- A **README.md** describing:
  - Source of chemical data
  - Creation steps (software used, parameters)
  - Any modifications from canonical structures

## Notes
- These files are intended as starting points for modeling and refinement.  
- Accuracy depends on the quality of source chemical data and the modeling process.
- If you spot an error in a structure, please open an issue or suggest a correction.

## License
Unless otherwise noted in subfolders, these files are shared under the MIT license, so you are free to use and share as you please.
