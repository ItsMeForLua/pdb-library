# Molecule: [Name of molecule]

**Chemical Formula:** [e.g., C16H28N4O4S]  
**Molecular Weight:** [e.g., 372.49 g/mol]  
**Source Data:** [Source of original chemical data — PubChem CID, literature reference, etc.]  
**Structure Creation Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  

## Description
Brief description of the molecule, what it is, and why this file was created.  
If it’s a ligand or metabolite, mention known biological role or context.  
Example: “Biocytin is a derivative of biotin covalently linked to lysine, often used in biochemical labeling and assays. No standalone PDB was available in public databases, so this structure was created from PubChem data.”
